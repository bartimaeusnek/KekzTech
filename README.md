# KekzTech
A Minecraft mod for the 1.7.10 modpack GTNH.
No compatibility outside GTNH guaranteed.

My mod adds Solid Oxide Fuel Cells to turn gas fuels into electricity and steam, a multi tank that can store up to 25 different fluids in one structure, and a nuclear reactor in the future.

Solid Oxide Fuel Cell MK1 and MK2:
